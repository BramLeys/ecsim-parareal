THESIS QUESTIONS:
- What am I exactly going to research? A combination of ECSIM with parareal/PFASST?

- What are your guidelines for literature study style/content/...?

- Guidelines for thesis style/content/...?
	subcycling; jacon, gpu using

- What timeline do you foresee
	
- Main goals vs secundary goals (need to have vs nice to have)
	need: working with subcycling
	nice: gpus

- problem statement, initial results, goals second semester

ECSIM QUESTIONS:
- Shouldn't there be a + in the alpha matrix instead of -? -> ja

- How come the energy conservation is checked by checking difference of energydiff, shouldn't you just check that the energy diff ~0 -> only guaranteed conservation each step?

- What in literatuurstudie -> introduction/progress report

- make tolerance for energy and states (1e-5, 1e-11) -> done

- check difference in difference -> is not good

- landau damping/ diffusion dominated problem -> difficult

- should you stop calculating steps just cause they hit arbitrary threshold or only when hitting machine precision?

- ask giovanni for symplectic integrators/ parareal symplectic, with plot 2 -> did not know anything and symplectic is not viable anyways

THESIS POINTS
- fine and parareal do not converge to same result for hyperbolic choatic example (only after long period -> correct implementation)
- energy conservation
- thresholds = 1e-8, 1e-12, 1e-16
- multiple symplectic integrators and parareal integrators -> not done
- split errors on x, v, E, B since they can all have way different normalisations
- also you are using equations with normalised units see ipic3D
- thesis is foundation for HPC gpus, but no implementation given
- coarse solvers : different time step, subcycling, different gridsize/particles
- there is no reason to approximate fine solution to 1e-16 since this is still just an approximation anyways
- why subcycling: use cores dedicated for parallelising fine in coarse as wel instead of idling


PLOTS:
- fine and parareal converge to same result (over small timeframes)
- errors on states to the timerange for different k (legend)
- 

Simulate long time on a lot of cores
no distributed memory
first gpu -> more cores -> more parameter studies

QUESTIONS
- How to incorporate the final (or first cell), it should also get coarsened or refined but is not done if you go from e.g 64 -> 127
- How to coarsen: take one value or average over multiple

TASKS:
- landau damping (done?)
- find energy conservation examples (why important) (high-fidelity simulations: Dense Z-pinch, fusion(ICF))
- look at convergence for total error of state and separated (done, E has large relative errors, but x errors are larger in absolute value -> E errors get divided by larger number if joined)
- check divergence of B, plot divergence of B for time evolution ( 0: but is not actually useful since in 1D the x-axis is only relevant axis, but remains the same during simulation)
- test with fewer particles (coarsening: choose from [min,max]) 1:2
- test with coarser grid 1:2 (128:256)
- (try GMRES) (works i guess)
- try for fewer cores 4,8,12
- try only calculating position, velocity during course and calculate everything during fine (does not work, electric and magnetic fields are normally the laggards in terms of error)
- get the results for 2, 5 and 10 subcycling steps
