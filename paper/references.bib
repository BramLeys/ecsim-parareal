	abstract = {A temporal multiscale hybridization method is presented that carefully couples coarse scale gyrokinetic models with exact charged particle solution trajectories (that is, with full phase information) in a magnetic field. The approach is based on the careful approximation of a sum, generally employed for time-parallel (TP) computing applications. While the hybridization method presented is highly parallelizable, a computational efficiency gain is seen from considering serial computations only. A complete numerical method is only presented for the aforementioned charged particle application, however, the general approach depicted likely has relevance to a wide swath of challenging multiscale/multiphysics problems. Additionally, the approach has obvious relevance to TP computing applications (such as variable selection on which to perform TP calculations and fine scale sampling strategies).},

	abstract = {Time parallel time integration methods have received renewed interest over the last decade because of the advent of massively parallel computers, which is mainly due to the clock speed limit reached on today’s processors. When solving time dependent partial differential equations, the time direction is usually not used for parallelization. But when parallelization in space saturates, the time direction offers itself as a further direction for parallelization. The time direction is however special, and for evolution problems there is a causality principle: the solution later in time is affected (it is even determined) by the solution earlier in time, but not the other way round. Algorithms trying to use the time direction for parallelization must therefore be special, and take this very different property of the time dimension into account.We show in this chapter how time domain decomposition methods were invented, and give an overview of the existing techniques. Time parallel methods can be classified into four different groups: methods based on multiple shooting, methods based on domain decomposition and waveform relaxation, space-time multigrid methods and direct time parallel methods. We show for each of these techniques the main inventions over time by choosing specific publications and explaining the core ideas of the authors. This chapter is for people who want to quickly gain an overview of the exciting and rapidly developing area of research of time parallel methods.},

Because implementations of deferred corrections can be pipelined, multi-core computing has increased the importance of deferred correction methods in practice, especially in the context of solving initial-value problems. In this paper, we review the theoretical underpinnings of deferred correction methods in a uniﬁed manner, speciﬁcally the classical algorithm of Zadunaisky/Stetter, the method of Dutt, Greengard and Rokhlin, spectral deferred correction, and integral deferred correction. We highlight some nuances of their implementations, including the choice of quadrature nodes, interpolants, and combinations of discretization methods, in a uniﬁed notation. We analyze how time-integration methods based on deferred correction can be effective solvers on modern computer architectures and demonstrate their performance. Lightweight and ﬂexible Matlab software is provided for exploration with modern variants of deferred correction methods.},

	title={Multigrid methods nonlinear problems: an overview},
	doi = {10.1117/12.499473},
	abstract = {Since their early application to elliptic partial differential equations, multigrid methods have been applied successfully to a large and growing class of problems, from elasticity and computational fluid dynamics to geodetics and molecular structures. Classical multigrid begins with a two-grid process. First, iterative relaxation is applied, whose effect is to smooth the error. Then a coarse-grid correction is applied, in which the smooth error is determined on a coarser grid. This error is interpolated to the fine grid and used to correct the fine-grid approximation. Applying this method recursively to solve the coarse-grid problem leads to multigrid. The coarse-grid correction works because the residual equation is linear. But this is not the case for nonlinear problems, and different strategies must be employed. In this presentation we describe how to apply multigrid to nonlinear problems. There are two basic approaches. The first is to apply a linearization scheme, such as the Newton's method, and to employ multigrid for the solution of the Jacobian system in each iteration. The second is to apply multigrid directly to the nonlinear problem by employing the so-called Full Approximation Scheme (FAS). In FAS a nonlinear iteration is applied to smooth the error. The full equation is solved on the coarse grid, after which the coarse-grid error is extracted from the solution. This correction is then interpolated and applied to the fine grid approximation. We describe these methods in detail, and present numerical experiments that indicate the efficacy of them.},

	volume = {5},
	doi = {10.1063/1.860903},
	abstract = {A simple, one-field, two-nonlinearity, drift wave model equation is derived to describe the dynamics of a nonuniform magnetized plasma by taking into account the effects of dissipative trapped electron response in the turbulence dynamics. Because of the nonadiabatic response of trapped electrons, mode couplings by both the [bold E][times][bold B] drift and the polarization drift nonlinearities are present. In this work, the statistical dynamics for this dissipative drift wave turbulence is investigated using the EDQNM (eddy-damped quasinormal Markovian) closure scheme. In particular, apart from the eddy viscosity, a large nonlinear frequency shift is shown to be induced by cross coupling of the two nonlinearities. Thus instability drive is modified by this turbulent back reaction. By taking into account this self-consistency effect, a wave kinetic equation is derived, and the density fluctuation spectrum is obtained in different parameter ranges. The results show that the dynamics of dissipative drift wave turbulence is fundamentally different from that of the familiar Hasegawa--Mima model, because [bold E][times][bold B] drift nonlinearity blocks the low-[ital k] condensation of fluctuation energy. It is shown that both the [bold E][times][bold B] drift nonlinearity and the nonlinear frequency shift effect transfer energy nonlocally from large to small scales and, in contrast to the predictions of dimensional analysis, their contribution to the nonlinear transfer processes are actually of the same order as that of the polarization drift nonlinearity, [ital even] within the Hasegawa--Mima regime. This results in a significant modification of the Hasegawa--Mima spectrum for the short-wavelength drift waves.},

	abstract = {The guiding center and gyrokinetic theory of magnetized particle motion is extended to the regime of large electric field gradients perpendicular to the magnetic field. A gradient in the electric field directly modifies the oscillation frequency and causes the Larmor orbits to deform from circular to elliptical trajectories. In order to retain a good adiabatic invariant, there can only be strong dependence on a single coordinate at lowest order, so that resonances do not generate chaotic motion that destroys the invariant. When the gradient across magnetic flux surfaces is dominant, the guiding center drift velocity becomes anisotropic in response to external forces and additional curvature drifts must be included. The electric polarization density remains gyrotropic, but both the polarization and magnetization are modified by the change in gyrofrequency. The theory can be applied to shear flows that are even stronger than those observed in the edge transport barrier of a high-performance tokamak (H-mode) pedestal, even if the toroidal field is as small as or even smaller than the poloidal field. Yet, the theory retains a mathematical form that is similar to the standard case and can readily be implemented within existing simulation tools.},

PFASST’s multi-level hierarchy allows to use the coarse level for correcting the reconstructed solution, which can help to minimize overhead. A theoretical model is devised linking overhead to the number of additional PFASST iterations required for convergence after a fault.

For non-stiff problems, the stability behavior of the obtained explicit schemes is very satisfactory and algorithms with orders between 8 and 20 should be competitive with the best existing ones.

	abstract = {Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS, pronounced "sea-moss", , ) is a type of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) fabrication process that uses complementary and symmetrical pairs of p-type and n-type MOSFETs for logic functions. CMOS technology is used for constructing integrated circuit (IC) chips, including microprocessors, microcontrollers, memory chips (including CMOS BIOS), and other digital logic circuits. CMOS technology is also used for analog circuits such as image sensors (CMOS sensors), data converters, RF circuits (RF CMOS), and highly integrated transceivers for many types of communication.
The CMOS process was originally conceived by Frank Wanlass at Fairchild Semiconductor and presented by Wanlass and Chih-Tang Sah at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference in 1963. Wanlass later filed US patent 3,356,858 for CMOS circuitry and it was granted in 1967. RCA commercialized the technology with the trademark "COS-MOS" in the late 1960s, forcing other manufacturers to find another name, leading to "CMOS" becoming the standard name for the technology by the early 1970s. CMOS overtook NMOS logic as the dominant MOSFET fabrication process for very large-scale integration (VLSI) chips in the 1980s, also replacing earlier transistor–transistor logic (TTL) technology. CMOS has since remained the standard fabrication process for MOSFET semiconductor devices in VLSI chips. As of 2011, 99\% of IC chips, including most digital, analog and mixed-signal ICs, were fabricated using CMOS technology.Two important characteristics of CMOS devices are high noise immunity and low static power consumption.
Since one transistor of the MOSFET pair is always off, the series combination draws significant power only momentarily during switching between on and off states. Consequently, CMOS devices do not produce as much waste heat as other forms of logic, like NMOS logic or transistor–transistor logic (TTL), which normally have some standing current even when not changing state. These characteristics allow CMOS to integrate a high density of logic functions on a chip. It was primarily for this reason that CMOS became the most widely used technology to be implemented in VLSI chips.
The phrase "metal–oxide–semiconductor" is a reference to the physical structure of MOS field-effect transistors, having a metal gate electrode placed on top of an oxide insulator, which in turn is on top of a semiconductor material. Aluminium was once used but now the material is polysilicon. Other metal gates have made a comeback with the advent of high-κ dielectric materials in the CMOS process, as announced by IBM and Intel for the 45 nanometer node and smaller sizes.},

	abstract = {The parareal algorithm is used to obtain temporal parallelization added to the parallelism obtained from the conventional spatial domain decomposition techniques for hydrodynamic problems. Parareal solution becomes unstable at high Reynolds numbers where the non-linear convection term in the Navier–Stokes equations becomes much larger than the diffusion term. A new framework that allows using parareal for unsteady high Reynolds number hydrodynamic problems is proposed where parareal coarse and fine time integration operators are incorporated with coarse and fine spatial grids respectively and RANS or DES turbulence models are employed with a blended filter that can be tuned for the stability of the method. This framework is composed of three solution stages where parareal serves as a transitional stage that bridges a coarse grid solution to a fine grid one. While in lower Reynolds number problems parareal solution can serve as a final solution, in higher Reynolds number problems with high degree of non-linearity parareal provides a shorter path to the final solution. Anticipating a parareal stage in a transitional sense allows a looser convergence requirement which leads to high speedup gains in that stage. On the other hand improved initial values at the beginning of the last stage yields a shorter final fine stage solution. A windowing technique is employed in this methodology to further control the parareal instabilities by keeping the parareal corrections smaller while still being able to cover an arbitrary simulation time with given computational resources. Application of this methodology has been illustrated with a fully turbulent vortex shedding from a cylinder and a flow from the Grand Passage tidal zone in the Bay of Fundy. It is concluded that a tuned turbulence model may sufficiently stabilize the parareal methodology for many practical problems such that it becomes applicable in the initialization process if not accurate enough as a final solution. MPI and OpenMP programming paradigms are used for temporal parallelism introduced by parareal and data parallelism obtained via spatial domain decomposition methods respectively. Also all computational tasks are accelerated using CUDA compatible GPGPUs.},

By combining standard linear stability analysis with a simple convergence analysis, we find that certain Parareal configurations can achieve parallel speedup on non-diffusive equations. These stable configurations possess low iteration counts, large block sizes, and a large number of processors.

	abstract = {The use of explicit particle-in-cell (PIC) method for relativistic plasma simulations is restricted by numerical heating and instabilities that may significantly constrain the choice of time and space steps. To eliminate these limitations we consider a possibility to enforce exact energy conservation by altering the standard time step splitting. Instead of particle advancement in a given field followed by field advancement with current, we split the step so that each particle is coupled with the field at the nearby nodes and this coupling is accounted for with enforced energy conservation sequentially for all particles. Such a coupling method is compatible with various advances, ranging from accounting for additional physical effects to the use of numerical-dispersion-free field solvers, high-order weighting shapes and particle push subcycling. To facilitate further considerations and use, we provide a basic implementation in a 3D, relativistic, spectral code π-PIC, which we make publicly available. The method and its implementations are verified using simulations of cold plasma oscillations, Landau damping and relativistic two-stream instability. The capabilities of the method to deal with large time and space steps are demonstrated in the problem of plasma heating by intense incident radiation.},

On propose dans cette Note un schéma permettant de profiter d'une architecture parallèle pour la discrétisation en temps d'une équation d'évolution aux dérivées partielles. Cette méthode, basée sur un schéma d'Euler, combine des résolutions grossières et des résolutions fines et indépendantes en temps en s'inspirant de ce qui est classique en espace. La parallélisation qui en résulte se fait dans la direction temporelle ce qui est en revanche non classique. Elle a pour principale motivation les problèmes en temps réel, d'où la terminologie proposée de «pararéel ».
The purpose of this Note is to propose a time discretization of a partial differential evolution equation that allows for parallel implementations. The method, based on an Euler scheme, combines coarse resolutions and independent fine resolutions in time in the same spirit as standard spacial approximations. The resulting parallel implementation is done in the non standard time direction. Its main goal concerns real time problems, hence the proposed terminology of “parareal” algorithm.},

	abstract = {The Earth’s magnetosphere is the outermost layer of the geospace system deflecting energetic charged particles from the Sun and solar wind. The solar wind has major impacts on the Earth’s magnetosphere, but it is unclear whether the same holds for solar flares—a sudden eruption of electromagnetic radiation on the Sun. Here we use a recently developed whole geospace model combined with observational data from the 6 September 2017 X9.3 solar flare event to reveal solar flare effects on magnetospheric dynamics and on the electrodynamic coupling between the magnetosphere and its adjacent ionosphere, the ionized part of Earth’s upper atmosphere. We observe a rapid and large increase in flare-induced photoionization of the polar ionospheric E-region at altitudes between 90 km and 150 km. This reduces the efficiency of mechanical energy conversion in the dayside solar wind–magnetosphere interaction, resulting in less Joule heating of the Earth’s upper atmosphere, a reconfiguration of magnetosphere convection, as well as changes in dayside and nightside auroral precipitation. This work thus demonstrates that solar flare effects extend throughout the geospace via electrodynamic coupling, and are not limited—as previously believed—to the atmospheric region where radiation energy is absorbed1.},

	abstract = {Nuclear fusion using magnetic confinement, in particular in the tokamak configuration, is a promising path towards sustainable energy. A core challenge is to shape and maintain a high-temperature plasma within the tokamak vessel. This requires high-dimensional, high-frequency, closed-loop control using magnetic actuator coils, further complicated by the diverse requirements across a wide range of plasma configurations. In this work, we introduce a previously undescribed architecture for tokamak magnetic controller design that autonomously learns to command the full set of control coils. This architecture meets control objectives specified at a high level, at the same time satisfying physical and operational constraints. This approach has unprecedented flexibility and generality in problem specification and yields a notable reduction in design effort to produce new plasma configurations. We successfully produce and control a diverse set of plasma configurations on the Tokamak à Configuration Variable1,2, including elongated, conventional shapes, as well as advanced configurations, such as negative triangularity and ‘snowflake’ configurations. Our approach achieves accurate tracking of the location, current and shape for these configurations. We also demonstrate sustained ‘droplets’ on TCV, in which two separate plasmas are maintained simultaneously within the vessel. This represents a notable advance for tokamak feedback control, showing the potential of reinforcement learning to accelerate research in the fusion domain, and is one of the most challenging real-world systems to which reinforcement learning has been applied.},

The book consists of two major parts: the first deals with the classical resistive approach, while the second presents an overview of weakly collisional or collisionless plasmas. Applications primarily concern astrophysical phenomena and dynamo theory, with emphasis on the solar and geodynamo, as well as magnetospheric substorms, the most spectacular reconnection events in the magnetospheric plasma. The theoretical procedures and results also apply directly to reconnection processes in laboratory plasmas, in particular the sawtooth phenomenon in tokamaks.

	abstract = {It is commonly believed that the divergence equations in the Maxwell equations are “redundant” for transient and timeharmonic problems, therefore most of the numerical methods in computational electromagnetics solve only two first-order curl equations or the second-order curl–curl equations. This misconception is the true origin of spurious modes and inaccurate solutions in computational electromagnetics. By studying the div–curl system this paper clarifies that the first-order Maxwell equations are not “overdetermined,” and the divergence equations must always be included to maintain the ellipticity of the system in the space domain, to guarantee the uniqueness of the solution and the accuracy of the numerical methods, and to eliminate the infinitely degenerate eigenvalue. This paper shows that the common derivation and usage of the second-order curl–curl equations are incorrect and that the solution of Helmholtz equations needs the divergence condition to be enforced on an associated part of the boundary. The div–curl method and the least-squares method introduced in this paper provide rigorous derivation of the equivalent second-order Maxwell equations and their boundary conditions. The node-based least-squares finite element method (LSFEM) is recommended for solving the first-order full Maxwell equations directly. Examples of the numerical solutions by LSFEM are given to demonstrate that the LSFEM is free of spurious solutions.},

The application of multigrid to unstructured grid problems, however, is not well developed. We discuss a method, that uses many of the same techniques as the finite element method itself, to apply standard multigrid algorithms to unstructured finite element problems. We use maximal independent sets (MISs) as a mechanism to automatically coarsen unstructured grids; the inherent flexibility in the selection of an MIS allows for the use of heuristics to improve their effectiveness for a multigrid solver. We present parallel algorithms, based on geometric heuristics, to optimize the quality of MISs and the meshes constructed from them, for use in multigrid solvers for 3D unstructured problems. We conduct scalability studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on a problem in large deformation elasticity and plasticity of up to 40 million degrees of freedom on 960 processor IBM PowerPC 4-way SMP cluster with about 60\% parallel efficiency.},

Some a priori error estimation are obtained and optimal error bounds in both H1-normal and L2-normal are derived. Finally, numerical results are reported to test and verify the feasibility and validity of our methods.},

We expose the trade-off between allocating system-wide power budget uniformly and greedily under different system-wide power constraints in an oversubscribed system. We experimentally demonstrate that, under the tightest power constraint, the mean productivity of the greedy allocation is 38 percent higher than the uniform allocation whereas, under the intermediate power constraint, the uniform allocation has a mean productivity of 6 percent higher than the greedy allocation. We then propose a new algorithm that adapts its behavior to deliver the combined beneﬁts of the two allocation strategies. We design a methodology with online retraining capability to create application-speciﬁc power-execution time models for a class of HPC applications. These models are used in predicting the execution time of an application on the available resources at the time of making scheduling decisions in the power-aware algorithms. We evaluate the proposed algorithm using emulation and simulation environments, and show that our adaptive strategy results in improving HPC resource utilization while delivering a mean productivity that is almost the same as the best performing algorithm across various system-wide power constraints.},

This algorithm has been implemented on many types of time-dependent problems with some success. Recent contributions have allowed one to extend the domain of application of the parareal in time algorithm so as to handle long-time simulations of Hamiltonian systems. This improvement has managed to avoid the fatally large lack of accuracy of the plain parareal in time algorithm, which does not conserve invariant quantities. A somewhat similar difficulty occurs for problems where the solution lacks regularity, either initially or during the evolution, as is the case for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. In this paper we identify the reasons for instabilities of the parareal in time algorithm and propose a simple way to cure them. We use the new method to solve a linear wave equation and a nonlinear Burgers' equation. The results illustrate the stability of this variant of the parareal in time algorithm.

They are time consuming and it is natural to consider the use of parallel architectures for reasons of efficiency. In this context the parareal algorithm has been proposed by several authors. The present work is a theoretical study of the parareal algorithm when it is applied to Hamiltonian differential equations. The idea of backward error analysis is employed to get insight into the long-time behavior of numerical approximations. One of the main results is that convergence of the parareal iterations restricts the length of the time window. For nearly integrable systems its length is bounded by the square root of the inverse of the accuracy of the coarse integrator. The theoretical bounds are confirmed by numerical experiments.},

It is based on a decomposition of the time interval into subintervals, and on a predictor-corrector strategy, where the propagations over each subinterval for the corrector stage are concurrently performed on the diﬀerent processors that are available. In this article, we are concerned with the long time integration of Hamiltonian systems. Geometric, structure-preserving integrators are preferably employed for such systems because they show interesting numerical properties, in particular excellent preservation of the total energy of the system. Using a symmetrization procedure and/or a (possibly also symmetric) projection step, we introduce here several variants of the original plain parareal in time algorithm [L. Baﬃco, et al. Phys. Rev.

These variants are compatible with the geometric structure of the exact dynamics, and are easy to implement.

In this paper, we present an optimized PGAS-like runtime system which uses the new MPI-3 shared-memory extensions to serve intra-node communication requests and MPI-3 one-sided communication primitives to serve inter-node communication requests. The performance of our runtime system is evaluated on a Cray XC40 system through low-level communication benchmarks, a random-access benchmark and a stencil kernel. The results of the experiments demonstrate that the performance of our hybrid runtime system matches the performance of low-level RMA libraries for intra-node transfers, and that of MPI-3 for inter-node transfers.},

To evaluate the pertinence of hybrid models for existing MPI codes, we compare a unified model (MPI) and a hybrid one (OpenMP fine grain parallelization after profiling) for the NAS 2.3 benchmarks on two IBM SP systems. The superiority of one model depends on 1) the level of shared memory model parallelization, 2) the communication patterns and 3) the memory access patterns. The relative speeds of the main architecture components (CPU, memory, and network) are of tremendous importance for selecting one model. With the used hybrid model, our results show that a unified MPI approach is better for most of the benchmarks. The hybrid approach becomes better only when fast processors make the communication performance significant and the level of parallelization is sufficient.},

Compared to the traditional hybrid approach of MPI plus OpenMP, a new, but promising hybrid approach of MPI plus MPI-3 shared-memory extensions (MPI+MPI) is gaining attraction. We describe an algorithmic approach for collective operations (with allgather and broadcast as concrete examples) in the context of hybrid MPI+MPI, so as to minimize memory consumption and memory copies. With this approach, only one memory copy is maintained and shared by on-node processes. This allows the removal of unnecessary on-node copies of replicated data that are required between MPI processes when the collectives are invoked in the context of pure MPI. We compare our approach of collectives for hybrid MPI+MPI and the traditional one for pure MPI, and also have a discussion on the synchronization that is required to guarantee data integrity. The performance of our approach has been validated on a Cray XC40 system (Cray MPI) and NEC cluster (Open MPI), showing that it achieves comparable or better performance for allgather operations. We have further validated our approach with a standard computational kernel, namely distributed matrix multiplication, and a Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization code.},

	abstract = {The advent of multi-/many-core processors in clusters advocates hybrid parallel programming, which combines Message Passing Interface (MPI) for inter-node parallelism with a shared memory model for on-node parallelism. Compared to the traditional hybrid approach of MPI plus OpenMP, a new, but promising hybrid approach of MPI plus MPI-3 shared-memory extensions (MPI+MPI) is gaining attraction. We describe an algorithmic approach for collective operations (with allgather and broadcast as concrete examples) in the context of hybrid MPI+MPI, so as to minimize memory consumption and memory copies. With this approach, only one memory copy is maintained and shared by on-node processes. This allows the removal of unnecessary on-node copies of replicated data that are required between MPI processes when the collectives are invoked in the context of pure MPI. We compare our approach of collectives for hybrid MPI+MPI and the traditional one for pure MPI, and also have a discussion on the synchronization that is required to guarantee data integrity. The performance of our approach has been validated on a Cray XC40 system (Cray MPI) and NEC cluster (OpenMPI), showing that it achieves comparable or better performance for allgather operations. We have further validated our approach with a standard computational kernel, namely distributed matrix multiplication, and a Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization code.},

	title = {Ad {Hoc} {Synchronization} {Considered} {Harmful}.},
	abstract = {Many synchronizations in existing multi-threaded programs are implemented in an ad hoc way. The first part of this paper does a comprehensive characteristic study of ad hoc synchronizations in concurrent programs. By studying 229 ad hoc synchronizations in 12 programs of various types (server, desktop and scientific), including Apache, MySQL, Mozilla, etc., we find several interesting and perhaps alarming characteristics: (1) Every studied application uses ad hoc synchronizations. Specifically, there are 6-83 ad hoc synchronizations in each program. (2) Ad hoc synchronizations are error-prone. Significant percentages (22-67\%) of these ad hoc synchronizations introduced bugs or severe performance issues. (3) Ad hoc synchronization implementations are diverse and many of them cannot be easily recognized as synchronizations, i.e. have poor readability and maintainability. The second part of our work builds a tool called SyncFinder to automatically identify and annotate ad hoc synchronizations in concurrent programswritten in C/C++ to assist programmers in porting their code to better structured implementations, while also enabling other tools to recognize them as synchronizations. Our evaluation using 25 concurrent programs shows that, on average, SyncFinder can automatically identify 96\% of ad hoc synchronizations with 6\% false positives. We also build two use cases to leverage SyncFinder's auto-annotation. The first one uses annotation to detect 5 deadlocks (including 2 new ones) and 16 potential issues missed by previous analysis tools in Apache, MySQL and Mozilla. The second use case reduces Valgrind data race checker's false positive rates by 43-86\%.},

Parts of the MPI\_Alltoall implementation relies on MPI derived datatypes; however, the MPI collective interfaces lack expressivity to take full advantage of the performance benefits offered by the derived datatype mechanism.},

	abstract = {The automatic selection of an appropriate time step size has been considered extensively in the literature. However, most of the strategies developed operate under the assumption that the computational cost (per time step) is independent of the step size. This assumption is reasonable for non-stiff ordinary differential equations and for partial differential equations where the linear systems of equations resulting from an implicit integrator are solved by direct methods. It is, however, usually not satisfied if iterative (for example, Krylov) methods are used. In this paper, we propose a step size selection strategy that adaptively reduces the computational cost (per unit time step) as the simulation progresses, constraint by the tolerance specified. We show that the proposed approach yields significant improvements in performance for a range of problems (diffusion–advection equation, Burgers' equation with a reaction term, porous media equation, viscous Burgers' equation, Allen–Cahn equation, and the two-dimensional Brusselator system). While traditional step size controllers have emphasized a smooth sequence of time step sizes, we emphasize the exploration of different step sizes which necessitates relatively rapid changes in the step size.},

We derive error bounds via a functional calculus of Arnoldi and Lanczos methods that reduces the study of Krylov subspace approximations of functions of matrices to that of linear systems of equations. As a side result, we obtain error bounds for Galerkin-type Krylov methods for linear equations, namely, the biconjugate gradient method and the full orthogonalization method. For Krylov approximations to matrix exponentials, we show superlinear error decay from relatively small iteration numbers onwards, depending on the geometry of the numerical range, the spectrum, or the pseudospectrum. The convergence to exp\$({\textbackslash}tau A)v\$ is faster than that of corresponding Krylov methods for the solution of linear equations \$(I-{\textbackslash}tau A)x=v\$, which usually arise in the numerical solution of stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We therefore propose a new class of time integration methods for large systems of nonlinear differential equations which use Krylov approximations to the exponential function of the Jacobian instead of solving linear or nonlinear systems of equations in every time step.},

The method combines elements of numerical stability and parallel algorithm design without increasing the computational costs. The algorithm is derived such that all inner products of a single iteration step are independent and communication time required for inner product can be overlapped eﬃciently with computation time of vector updates. Therefore, the cost of global communication which represents the bottleneck of the parallel performance can be signiﬁcantly reduced. The resulting IBiCGStab algorithm maintains the favorable properties of the original method while not increasing computational costs. Data distribution suitable for both irregularly and regularly structured matrices based on the analysis of the nonzero matrix elements is presented. Communication scheme is supported by overlapping execution of computation and communication to reduce waiting times. The eﬃciency of this method is demonstrated by numerical experimental results carried out on a massively parallel distributed memory system.},

	abstract = {Computer simulation of systems has become an important tool in scientific research and engineering design, including the simulation of systems through the motion of their constituent particles. Important examples of this are the motion of stars in galaxies, ions in hot gas plasmas, electrons in semiconductor devices, and atoms in solids and liquids. The behavior of the system is studied by programming into the computer a model of the system and then performing experiments with this model. New scientific insight is obtained by observing such computer experiments, often for controlled conditions that are not accessible in the laboratory. Computer Simulation using Particles deals with the simulation of systems by following the motion of their constituent particles. This book provides an introduction to simulation using particles based on the NGP, CIC, and P3M algorithms and the programming principles that assist with the preparations of large simulation programs based on the OLYMPUS methodology. It also includes case study examples in the fields of astrophysics, plasmas, semiconductors, and ionic solids as well as more detailed mathematical treatment of the models, such as their errors, dispersion, and optimization.This resource will help you understand how engineering design can be assisted by the ability to predict performance using the computer model before embarking on costly and time-consuming manufacture.},

Motivated by direct laser acceleration of electrons in sub-critical plasmas, we examine temporal resolution requirements that must be satisfied to accurately calculate electron dynamics in strong laser fields. Using the motion of a single electron in a perfect plane electromagnetic wave as a test problem, we show surprising deterioration of the numerical accuracy with increasing wave amplitude a0 for a given time-step. We go on to show analytically that the time-step must be significantly less than λ/ca0 to achieve good accuracy. We thus propose adaptive electron sub-cycling as an efficient remedy.},

	abstract = {In this paper we develop a two-grid convergence theory for the parallel-in-time scheme known as multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT), as it is implemented in the open-source  package [XBraid: Parallel Multigrid in Time, http://llnl.gov/casc/xbraid].  MGRIT is a scalable and multilevel approach to parallel-in-time simulations that nonintrusively uses existing time-stepping schemes, and in a specific two-level setting it is equivalent to the widely known parareal algorithm.  The goal of this paper is twofold.  First, we present a two-level MGRIT convergence analysis for linear problems where the spatial discretization matrix can be diagonalized, and then apply this analysis to our two basic model problems, the heat equation and the advection equation.  One important assumption is that the coarse and fine time-grid propagators can be diagaonalized by the same set of eigenvectors, which is often the case when the same spatial discretization operator is used on the coarse and fine time grids.  In many cases, the MGRIT algorithm is guaranteed to converge, and we demonstrate numerically that the theoretically predicted convergence rates are sharp in practice for our model problems.  Second, we explore how the convergence of MGRIT compares to the stability of the chosen time-stepping scheme.  In particular, we demonstrate that a stable time-stepping scheme does not necessarily imply convergence of MGRIT, although MGRIT with FCF-relaxation always converges for the diffusion dominated problems considered here.},

	abstract = {The use of explicit particle-in-cell (PIC) method for relativistic plasma simulations is restricted by numerical heating and instabilities that may significantly constrain the choice of time and space steps. To partially eliminate these limitations we consider a possibility to enforce exact energy conservation by altering the standard time step splitting. Instead of updating particles in a given field and then the field using the current they produce, we consider subsystems that describe the coupling of a single particle and the field at the nearby nodes and solve them with enforced energy conservation sequentially for all particles, which is completed by the field update with zero current. Such an approach is compatible with various advances, ranging from accounting for additional physical effects to the use of numerical-dispersion-free field solvers, high-order weighting shapes and particle push subcycling. To facilitate further considerations and use, we provide a basic implementation in a 3D, relativistic, spectral code π-PIC, which we make publicly available. The method and its implementations are verified using simulations of cold plasma oscillations, Landau damping and relativistic two-stream instability. The capabilities of the method to deal with large time and space steps are demonstrated in the problem of plasma heating by intense incident radiation.},
