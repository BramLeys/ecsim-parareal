	abstract = {A temporal multiscale hybridization method is presented that carefully couples coarse scale gyrokinetic models with exact charged particle solution trajectories (that is, with full phase information) in a magnetic field. The approach is based on the careful approximation of a sum, generally employed for time-parallel (TP) computing applications. While the hybridization method presented is highly parallelizable, a computational efficiency gain is seen from considering serial computations only. A complete numerical method is only presented for the aforementioned charged particle application, however, the general approach depicted likely has relevance to a wide swath of challenging multiscale/multiphysics problems. Additionally, the approach has obvious relevance to TP computing applications (such as variable selection on which to perform TP calculations and fine scale sampling strategies).},

	abstract = {Time parallel time integration methods have received renewed interest over the last decade because of the advent of massively parallel computers, which is mainly due to the clock speed limit reached on today’s processors. When solving time dependent partial differential equations, the time direction is usually not used for parallelization. But when parallelization in space saturates, the time direction offers itself as a further direction for parallelization. The time direction is however special, and for evolution problems there is a causality principle: the solution later in time is affected (it is even determined) by the solution earlier in time, but not the other way round. Algorithms trying to use the time direction for parallelization must therefore be special, and take this very different property of the time dimension into account.We show in this chapter how time domain decomposition methods were invented, and give an overview of the existing techniques. Time parallel methods can be classified into four different groups: methods based on multiple shooting, methods based on domain decomposition and waveform relaxation, space-time multigrid methods and direct time parallel methods. We show for each of these techniques the main inventions over time by choosing specific publications and explaining the core ideas of the authors. This chapter is for people who want to quickly gain an overview of the exciting and rapidly developing area of research of time parallel methods.},

	abstract = {The Energy Conserving semi-implicit method (ECsim), presented by Lapenta in 2017, is a Particle in Cell (PIC) algorithm for the simulation of plasmas. Energy conservation is achieved within a semi-implicit formulation that does not require any non-linear solver. A mass matrix is introduced to express linearly the particle-field coupling. With the mass matrix the algorithm preserves energy conservation to machine precision. The construction of the mass matrix is the central nature of the method and also the main cost of the computational cycle. We analyze here three methods that modify the construction of the mass matrix. First, we consider how the sub-cycling of the particle motion modifies the mass matrix. Second, we introduce a form of smoothing that reduces the noise while retaining exact energy conservation. Finally, we discuss an approximation of the mass matrix that transform the ECsim scheme to the implicit moment method.},

Because implementations of deferred corrections can be pipelined, multi-core computing has increased the importance of deferred correction methods in practice, especially in the context of solving initial-value problems. In this paper, we review the theoretical underpinnings of deferred correction methods in a uniﬁed manner, speciﬁcally the classical algorithm of Zadunaisky/Stetter, the method of Dutt, Greengard and Rokhlin, spectral deferred correction, and integral deferred correction. We highlight some nuances of their implementations, including the choice of quadrature nodes, interpolants, and combinations of discretization methods, in a uniﬁed notation. We analyze how time-integration methods based on deferred correction can be effective solvers on modern computer architectures and demonstrate their performance. Lightweight and ﬂexible Matlab software is provided for exploration with modern variants of deferred correction methods.},

	shorttitle = {Multigrid methods for nonlinear problems},
	doi = {10.1117/12.499473},
	abstract = {Since their early application to elliptic partial differential equations, multigrid methods have been applied successfully to a large and growing class of problems, from elasticity and computational fluid dynamics to geodetics and molecular structures. Classical multigrid begins with a two-grid process. First, iterative relaxation is applied, whose effect is to smooth the error. Then a coarse-grid correction is applied, in which the smooth error is determined on a coarser grid. This error is interpolated to the fine grid and used to correct the fine-grid approximation. Applying this method recursively to solve the coarse-grid problem leads to multigrid. The coarse-grid correction works because the residual equation is linear. But this is not the case for nonlinear problems, and different strategies must be employed. In this presentation we describe how to apply multigrid to nonlinear problems. There are two basic approaches. The first is to apply a linearization scheme, such as the Newton's method, and to employ multigrid for the solution of the Jacobian system in each iteration. The second is to apply multigrid directly to the nonlinear problem by employing the so-called Full Approximation Scheme (FAS). In FAS a nonlinear iteration is applied to smooth the error. The full equation is solved on the coarse grid, after which the coarse-grid error is extracted from the solution. This correction is then interpolated and applied to the fine grid approximation. We describe these methods in detail, and present numerical experiments that indicate the efficacy of them.},

	volume = {5},
	doi = {10.1063/1.860903},
	abstract = {A simple, one-field, two-nonlinearity, drift wave model equation is derived to describe the dynamics of a nonuniform magnetized plasma by taking into account the effects of dissipative trapped electron response in the turbulence dynamics. Because of the nonadiabatic response of trapped electrons, mode couplings by both the [bold E][times][bold B] drift and the polarization drift nonlinearities are present. In this work, the statistical dynamics for this dissipative drift wave turbulence is investigated using the EDQNM (eddy-damped quasinormal Markovian) closure scheme. In particular, apart from the eddy viscosity, a large nonlinear frequency shift is shown to be induced by cross coupling of the two nonlinearities. Thus instability drive is modified by this turbulent back reaction. By taking into account this self-consistency effect, a wave kinetic equation is derived, and the density fluctuation spectrum is obtained in different parameter ranges. The results show that the dynamics of dissipative drift wave turbulence is fundamentally different from that of the familiar Hasegawa--Mima model, because [bold E][times][bold B] drift nonlinearity blocks the low-[ital k] condensation of fluctuation energy. It is shown that both the [bold E][times][bold B] drift nonlinearity and the nonlinear frequency shift effect transfer energy nonlocally from large to small scales and, in contrast to the predictions of dimensional analysis, their contribution to the nonlinear transfer processes are actually of the same order as that of the polarization drift nonlinearity, [ital even] within the Hasegawa--Mima regime. This results in a significant modification of the Hasegawa--Mima spectrum for the short-wavelength drift waves.},

	abstract = {The guiding center and gyrokinetic theory of magnetized particle motion is extended to the regime of large electric field gradients perpendicular to the magnetic field. A gradient in the electric field directly modifies the oscillation frequency and causes the Larmor orbits to deform from circular to elliptical trajectories. In order to retain a good adiabatic invariant, there can only be strong dependence on a single coordinate at lowest order, so that resonances do not generate chaotic motion that destroys the invariant. When the gradient across magnetic flux surfaces is dominant, the guiding center drift velocity becomes anisotropic in response to external forces and additional curvature drifts must be included. The electric polarization density remains gyrotropic, but both the polarization and magnetization are modified by the change in gyrofrequency. The theory can be applied to shear flows that are even stronger than those observed in the edge transport barrier of a high-performance tokamak (H-mode) pedestal, even if the toroidal field is as small as or even smaller than the poloidal field. Yet, the theory retains a mathematical form that is similar to the standard case and can readily be implemented within existing simulation tools.},

For non-stiff problems, the stability behavior of the obtained explicit schemes is very satisfactory and algorithms with orders between 8 and 20 should be competitive with the best existing ones. In our preliminary experiments with stiff problems, a simple adaptive implementation of the method demonstrates performance comparable to that of a state-of-the-art extrapolation code (at least, at moderate to high precision).},

	abstract = {Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS, pronounced "sea-moss", , ) is a type of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) fabrication process that uses complementary and symmetrical pairs of p-type and n-type MOSFETs for logic functions. CMOS technology is used for constructing integrated circuit (IC) chips, including microprocessors, microcontrollers, memory chips (including CMOS BIOS), and other digital logic circuits. CMOS technology is also used for analog circuits such as image sensors (CMOS sensors), data converters, RF circuits (RF CMOS), and highly integrated transceivers for many types of communication.
The CMOS process was originally conceived by Frank Wanlass at Fairchild Semiconductor and presented by Wanlass and Chih-Tang Sah at the International Solid-State Circuits Conference in 1963. Wanlass later filed US patent 3,356,858 for CMOS circuitry and it was granted in 1967. RCA commercialized the technology with the trademark "COS-MOS" in the late 1960s, forcing other manufacturers to find another name, leading to "CMOS" becoming the standard name for the technology by the early 1970s. CMOS overtook NMOS logic as the dominant MOSFET fabrication process for very large-scale integration (VLSI) chips in the 1980s, also replacing earlier transistor–transistor logic (TTL) technology. CMOS has since remained the standard fabrication process for MOSFET semiconductor devices in VLSI chips. As of 2011, 99\% of IC chips, including most digital, analog and mixed-signal ICs, were fabricated using CMOS technology.Two important characteristics of CMOS devices are high noise immunity and low static power consumption.
Since one transistor of the MOSFET pair is always off, the series combination draws significant power only momentarily during switching between on and off states. Consequently, CMOS devices do not produce as much waste heat as other forms of logic, like NMOS logic or transistor–transistor logic (TTL), which normally have some standing current even when not changing state. These characteristics allow CMOS to integrate a high density of logic functions on a chip. It was primarily for this reason that CMOS became the most widely used technology to be implemented in VLSI chips.
The phrase "metal–oxide–semiconductor" is a reference to the physical structure of MOS field-effect transistors, having a metal gate electrode placed on top of an oxide insulator, which in turn is on top of a semiconductor material. Aluminium was once used but now the material is polysilicon. Other metal gates have made a comeback with the advent of high-κ dielectric materials in the CMOS process, as announced by IBM and Intel for the 45 nanometer node and smaller sizes.},

	abstract = {The parareal algorithm is used to obtain temporal parallelization added to the parallelism obtained from the conventional spatial domain decomposition techniques for hydrodynamic problems. Parareal solution becomes unstable at high Reynolds numbers where the non-linear convection term in the Navier–Stokes equations becomes much larger than the diffusion term. A new framework that allows using parareal for unsteady high Reynolds number hydrodynamic problems is proposed where parareal coarse and fine time integration operators are incorporated with coarse and fine spatial grids respectively and RANS or DES turbulence models are employed with a blended filter that can be tuned for the stability of the method. This framework is composed of three solution stages where parareal serves as a transitional stage that bridges a coarse grid solution to a fine grid one. While in lower Reynolds number problems parareal solution can serve as a final solution, in higher Reynolds number problems with high degree of non-linearity parareal provides a shorter path to the final solution. Anticipating a parareal stage in a transitional sense allows a looser convergence requirement which leads to high speedup gains in that stage. On the other hand improved initial values at the beginning of the last stage yields a shorter final fine stage solution. A windowing technique is employed in this methodology to further control the parareal instabilities by keeping the parareal corrections smaller while still being able to cover an arbitrary simulation time with given computational resources. Application of this methodology has been illustrated with a fully turbulent vortex shedding from a cylinder and a flow from the Grand Passage tidal zone in the Bay of Fundy. It is concluded that a tuned turbulence model may sufficiently stabilize the parareal methodology for many practical problems such that it becomes applicable in the initialization process if not accurate enough as a final solution. MPI and OpenMP programming paradigms are used for temporal parallelism introduced by parareal and data parallelism obtained via spatial domain decomposition methods respectively. Also all computational tasks are accelerated using CUDA compatible GPGPUs.},

By combining standard linear stability analysis with a simple convergence analysis, we find that certain Parareal configurations can achieve parallel speedup on non-diffusive equations. These stable configurations possess low iteration counts, large block sizes, and a large number of processors.

	abstract = {The use of explicit particle-in-cell (PIC) method for relativistic plasma simulations is restricted by numerical heating and instabilities that may significantly constrain the choice of time and space steps. To eliminate these limitations we consider a possibility to enforce exact energy conservation by altering the standard time step splitting. Instead of particle advancement in a given field followed by field advancement with current, we split the step so that each particle is coupled with the field at the nearby nodes and this coupling is accounted for with enforced energy conservation sequentially for all particles. Such a coupling method is compatible with various advances, ranging from accounting for additional physical effects to the use of numerical-dispersion-free field solvers, high-order weighting shapes and particle push subcycling. To facilitate further considerations and use, we provide a basic implementation in a 3D, relativistic, spectral code π-PIC, which we make publicly available. The method and its implementations are verified using simulations of cold plasma oscillations, Landau damping and relativistic two-stream instability. The capabilities of the method to deal with large time and space steps are demonstrated in the problem of plasma heating by intense incident radiation.},

On propose dans cette Note un schéma permettant de profiter d'une architecture parallèle pour la discrétisation en temps d'une équation d'évolution aux dérivées partielles. Cette méthode, basée sur un schéma d'Euler, combine des résolutions grossières et des résolutions fines et indépendantes en temps en s'inspirant de ce qui est classique en espace. La parallélisation qui en résulte se fait dans la direction temporelle ce qui est en revanche non classique. Elle a pour principale motivation les problèmes en temps réel, d'où la terminologie proposée de «pararéel ».
The purpose of this Note is to propose a time discretization of a partial differential evolution equation that allows for parallel implementations. The method, based on an Euler scheme, combines coarse resolutions and independent fine resolutions in time in the same spirit as standard spacial approximations. The resulting parallel implementation is done in the non standard time direction. Its main goal concerns real time problems, hence the proposed terminology of “parareal” algorithm.},

	abstract = {The Earth’s magnetosphere is the outermost layer of the geospace system deflecting energetic charged particles from the Sun and solar wind. The solar wind has major impacts on the Earth’s magnetosphere, but it is unclear whether the same holds for solar flares—a sudden eruption of electromagnetic radiation on the Sun. Here we use a recently developed whole geospace model combined with observational data from the 6 September 2017 X9.3 solar flare event to reveal solar flare effects on magnetospheric dynamics and on the electrodynamic coupling between the magnetosphere and its adjacent ionosphere, the ionized part of Earth’s upper atmosphere. We observe a rapid and large increase in flare-induced photoionization of the polar ionospheric E-region at altitudes between 90 km and 150 km. This reduces the efficiency of mechanical energy conversion in the dayside solar wind–magnetosphere interaction, resulting in less Joule heating of the Earth’s upper atmosphere, a reconfiguration of magnetosphere convection, as well as changes in dayside and nightside auroral precipitation. This work thus demonstrates that solar flare effects extend throughout the geospace via electrodynamic coupling, and are not limited—as previously believed—to the atmospheric region where radiation energy is absorbed1.},

	abstract = {Nuclear fusion using magnetic confinement, in particular in the tokamak configuration, is a promising path towards sustainable energy. A core challenge is to shape and maintain a high-temperature plasma within the tokamak vessel. This requires high-dimensional, high-frequency, closed-loop control using magnetic actuator coils, further complicated by the diverse requirements across a wide range of plasma configurations. In this work, we introduce a previously undescribed architecture for tokamak magnetic controller design that autonomously learns to command the full set of control coils. This architecture meets control objectives specified at a high level, at the same time satisfying physical and operational constraints. This approach has unprecedented flexibility and generality in problem specification and yields a notable reduction in design effort to produce new plasma configurations. We successfully produce and control a diverse set of plasma configurations on the Tokamak à Configuration Variable1,2, including elongated, conventional shapes, as well as advanced configurations, such as negative triangularity and ‘snowflake’ configurations. Our approach achieves accurate tracking of the location, current and shape for these configurations. We also demonstrate sustained ‘droplets’ on TCV, in which two separate plasmas are maintained simultaneously within the vessel. This represents a notable advance for tokamak feedback control, showing the potential of reinforcement learning to accelerate research in the fusion domain, and is one of the most challenging real-world systems to which reinforcement learning has been applied.},

Applications primarily concern astrophysical phenomena and dynamo theory, with emphasis on the solar and geodynamo, as well as magnetospheric substorms, the most spectacular reconnection events in the magnetospheric plasma. The theoretical procedures and results also apply directly to reconnection processes in laboratory plasmas, in particular the sawtooth phenomenon in tokamaks. The book will be of value to graduate students and researchers interested in magnetic processes both in astrophysical and laboratory plasma physics.},

	abstract = {It is commonly believed that the divergence equations in the Maxwell equations are “redundant” for transient and timeharmonic problems, therefore most of the numerical methods in computational electromagnetics solve only two first-order curl equations or the second-order curl–curl equations. This misconception is the true origin of spurious modes and inaccurate solutions in computational electromagnetics. By studying the div–curl system this paper clarifies that the first-order Maxwell equations are not “overdetermined,” and the divergence equations must always be included to maintain the ellipticity of the system in the space domain, to guarantee the uniqueness of the solution and the accuracy of the numerical methods, and to eliminate the infinitely degenerate eigenvalue. This paper shows that the common derivation and usage of the second-order curl–curl equations are incorrect and that the solution of Helmholtz equations needs the divergence condition to be enforced on an associated part of the boundary. The div–curl method and the least-squares method introduced in this paper provide rigorous derivation of the equivalent second-order Maxwell equations and their boundary conditions. The node-based least-squares finite element method (LSFEM) is recommended for solving the first-order full Maxwell equations directly. Examples of the numerical solutions by LSFEM are given to demonstrate that the LSFEM is free of spurious solutions.},

	abstract = {Multigrid is a popular solution method for the system of linear algebraic equations that arise from PDEs discretized with the finite element method. The application of multigrid to unstructured grid problems, however, is not well developed. We discuss a method, that uses many of the same techniques as the finite element method itself, to apply standard multigrid algorithms to unstructured finite element problems. We use maximal independent sets (MISs) as a mechanism to automatically coarsen unstructured grids; the inherent flexibility in the selection of an MIS allows for the use of heuristics to improve their effectiveness for a multigrid solver. We present parallel algorithms, based on geometric heuristics, to optimize the quality of MISs and the meshes constructed from them, for use in multigrid solvers for 3D unstructured problems. We conduct scalability studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on a problem in large deformation elasticity and plasticity of up to 40 million degrees of freedom on 960 processor IBM PowerPC 4-way SMP cluster with about 60\% parallel efficiency.},

	abstract = {In this article, two kinds of expandable parallel finite element methods, based on two-grid discretizations, are given to solve the linear elliptic problems. Compared with the classical local and parallel finite element methods, there are two attractive features of the methods shown in this article: 1) a partition of unity is used to generate a series of local and independent subproblems to guarantee the final approximation globally continuous; 2) the computational domain of each local subproblem is contained in a ball with radius of O(H) (H is the coarse mesh parameter), which means methods in this article are more suitable for parallel computing in a large parallel computer system. Some a priori error estimation are obtained and optimal error bounds in both H1-normal and L2-normal are derived. Finally, numerical results are reported to test and verify the feasibility and validity of our methods.},

	abstract = {A new method for modeling low-frequency plasma phenomena is presented. The method uses an implicit formulation of the Vlasov-Maxwell equations to relax restrictions on the time-step and mesh spacing so that larger values which correspond to the frequencies and wavelengths of interest can be used. As a result, the range of length and time scales accessible to plasma simulation is increased by orders of magnitude. The algorithm, as embodied in a new code VENUS for electromagnetic plasmas in two dimensions, is described, its stability and accuracy analyzed through linear and nonlinear analysis, and its properties, including suppression of the finite grid instability, illustrated through its application to the Weibel instability.},
